# Security Policy

## Supported versions

We currently support only the `main` branch and the latest tagged release.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue:

1. Do not create a public issue.
2. Contact the maintainer directly with:
   - Affected version
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Impact and proposed mitigation (if available)
3. Allow the maintainers time to validate and release a fix.

## Responsible disclosure

Please use a clear, concise, and actionable report. Include logs, stack traces,
and sample data if available.
