# docneedle Documentation Hub

This directory contains project documentation grouped by audience:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`: Product and architecture rationale.
- `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`: Installation and operator-facing usage.
- `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`: Module-level design, contracts, and extension points.
- `docs/PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`: Business-facing goals, value, and limitations.
- `docs/LEARNING_NOTES.md`: What contributors can learn from the codebase.
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: Runbook for common setup and runtime issues.

All docs should stay in sync with code behavior and CLI/runtime changes.
